This script reads in a listing of songs that represent an itunes playlist. This will change eventually...for
now the name of the file is called SamplePlaylist.txt. The format of the input is 'BandName*AlbumTitle*SongTitle*RuntimeOfSong

*You will have to install the isodate python module in order to get this to run

#Things to do
- Fix the script so it can accomodate runtimes that don't have a leading 0 in the runtime
- Subtract one or two seconds off of the runtime read in, and compare it to what was found.
- Read in an actual exported itunes playlist file....
- Add functionality for user to create a playlist on youtube account based on the results found
